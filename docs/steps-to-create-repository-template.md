# ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How was this repository created? 

I follow these steps to create this repository template with this architecture

## üíª Root npm project

```bash
# create project directory
$ mkdir nodejs-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton
$ cd nodejs-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton

# Init git repository
$ git init .

# Create npm project
$ npm init -y

# Then Update name, description, keywords and author in package.json. For example:

  name: "nodejs-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton",
  description: "Node.js Hexagonal Architecture + DDD:Repository template for your Node.js backend projects, designed for microservices",
  author: "Lionel gt",
  keywords: ["Node.js","nodejs","hexagonal architecture","ddd","skeleton","template","NestJs","TypeScript"],
}
```


## üß† Domain
Follow this steps to create any independent workspaces like domain
```bash

{
  name: "@skeleton/http-client"
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  description: "Http-client: Infrastructure module where we define our  clients to call external APIs."
}

#Add @skeleton/domain as a dependency of @skeleton/http-client 
#Because we need to implement our port adapters that were defined in our domain.
$ npm install @skeleton/domain --workspace=infrastructure/driven-adapters/http-client
#Dependencies will look like:
{
  "name": "@skeleton/http-client",
  "dependencies": {
    "@skeleton/domain": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### ‚õÅ Mongoose-repository
```bash
# Add mongoose-repository module as un independent workspace
$ npm init -y -workspace infrastructure/driven-adapters/mongoose-repository

# Then update name,description,main and author in package.json. For example:
{
  name: "@skeleton/mongoose-repository"
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  description: "Mongoose-repository: Infrastructure module where we model our application data"
}

#Dependencies will look like:
{
  "name": "@skeleton/application",
  "dependencies": {
    "@skeleton/mongoose-repository": "^1.0.0"

## ‚ôª Build Cycle Configuration
* Add typescript dependency `$ npm install typescript -D`
* Copy base [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/lionelgt/nodejs-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton/blob/main/tsconfig.json)
* Use Nx to manage build system: `npx nx init`. Check the generated [nx.json](https://github.com/lionelgt/nodejs-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton/blob/main/nx.json)
* Define script of clean and build on each workspaces.
  ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "clean": "rm -rf dist",
            "build": "npm run clean && tsc"
        }
    }
  ```
* Define script of clean, build and start in root project
  ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "clean": "nx run-many -t clean",
            "build": "nx run-many -t build",
            "start": "nx run @skeleton/application:start"
        }
    }
  ```
